## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in banking transactions using machine learning. Several models were trained and compared, with the **XGBoost classifier** chosen for deployment due to its **superior performance** in identifying anomalies accurately.

---

## 🧠 Models Evaluated

The following models were tested for anomaly detection:

### 🧪 **Unsupervised Learning Models**

* **Isolation Forest**
* **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
* **One-Class SVM**

### ✅ **Supervised Learning Model**

* **XGBoost Classifier** *(Final deployed model)*

All models were evaluated using:

* Confusion Matrix
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* ROC-AUC (for supervised)

📌 **XGBoost outperformed others and was selected for production deployment.**
